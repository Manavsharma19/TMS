The Timetable Management System (TMS) is an innovative solution designed to automate and optimize the scheduling process for educational institutions. Utilizing constraint programming and advanced algorithms, TMS efficiently generates conflict-free timetables while considering various constraints such as room availability, faculty preferences, and student schedules. Key features include user-friendly interfaces, dynamic constraint management, and robust security measures through Keycloak integration. The system enhances resource allocation, minimizes scheduling conflicts, and improves overall operational efficiency, making it an invaluable tool for administrators, faculty, and students alike.
